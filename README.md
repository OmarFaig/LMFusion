# LMFusion

An open framework for building large model applications that can reference physical data. LMFusion aims to provide an easy way to incorporate physical reality in reasoning applications (e.g., AI agents) in a simple and understandable way. It consists of a set of classes for structured geo-referencing, retreival, and model fine-tuning using geospatial data. It also provides integrations to services useful for loading, working with, and visualizing this data. 

Use LMFusion to make accessing and utilizing geospatial data (e.g., satellite imagery, maps, vector data, etc) easier when building applications that use large ai models that need to reason about the world.

Use cases (notebooks coming soon!)

## Why LMFusion?
This module is inspired by the writings of Yann Lecun (Meta) on model grounding in which he has highlighted why models require a mechanism for physically grounded reasoning. While large models perform well at next-token prediction, they do not have access to physical information and therefore can fail when asked for real-world predictions. This problem is still an open one. We assume that we are still in the beginning stages of modern AI with many breakthroughs to come.

Significant advances have been made in programmatic usage of models. Some projects we're familiar with include [LangChain](www.langchain.com), [LlamaIndex](www.llamaindex.ai), and [DSPy](dspy.ai). These projects were some of the first to explore how to incorporate LLMs into structured pipelines. More recent engineering efforts have focused on enabling LLMs to control real systems by giving them internet access, enforcing structured outputs, and enabling "tool calling". However, none of these modules have addressed physical grounding.

There are several startups we are aware of working on physical models and reasoning (see [Archetype AI](https://www.archetypeai.io/) and [Danti](https://danti.ai/)). These companies are closed source and are building products with limited scope for the markets they serve as opposed to releasing frameworks for reuse. LMFusion is focused on the latter.

To understand what we mean by "limited scope", consider the spectrum of data necessary for grounding model reasoning. On one end of the data spectrum is static content. This includes information about physical systems that doesn't change. Examples that come to mind include physics and mathematical models. On the other end of the spectrum is dynamic data: Any real-time information of the physical world that gets sensed by cameras, accelerometers, etc. To date, we know of no open architectures that enable reasoning applications to incorporate these data simply and reliably. More to the point, little progress has been made on geospatial data that sits in between static and dynamic (e.g., known locations, sizes / shapes of objects, earth observation data, and characteristics of geographic areas). To be clear, great strides have been made in making these data accessible and programmable at scale. Notable examples include [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/), [Microsoft Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/), and NASA's [Planetary Data System](https://pds.nasa.gov/). However, outside of academic research, we have not seen a module that ties these into applications that seek to reason over them using large models. We think there's tremendous value in making this possible.

## Large Models v. Frameworks

There has been some discussion in academia about whether RAG frameworks will survive the advance of language models. The argument is that RAG may be irrelvant in light of super-intelligent, large-context models.

In our view, these arguments do not seem to appreciate the challenge of grounding models in physical reality. The world is always changing and producing new data. Case in point: Daily open-source earth observation imagery generated by satellites is in the TB range! With the average cost for training a new large foundation model in the many millions (billions?) of dollars, it does not yet seem feasible to dismiss the importance of supplementing large models with new data.

Moreover, we observe that smaller, quantized foundation models typically used by the opensource community are not as competitive as their larger parents, which were built by corporations with $B budgets. Therefore, we assume that the opensource community has even more to gain by an open solution to physical data grounding.
